      --- run the code from the top to the auto labeling part
      
      --- get the csv file named 45k_after_slot_annotation.csv
      
2. How to get the inputs for models?

      --- use construct inputs for xxx part in the prepare_dataset.ipynb
      
      --- download seq.in, seq.out, label files and put them into train/valid/test folder

3. How to run the baseline models?

      --- upload the folders in the baseline_models folder to the Google drive
      
      --- open the ipynb files in the Colab
      
      --- set the path to your own path for storing the model folder
      
      --- run the code
      
4. How to get model results?

      --- After running the models, open the experiment_result_analysis.ipynb in the Colab
      
      --- run the corresponding part in the ipynb file
      
5. How to draw graphs?
